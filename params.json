Entirely imageless layout\r\n1. Lean, clean and optimized PHP\r\n1. Reducing database look-ups\r\n\r\n### Responsivemess\r\n\r\nTheme-Dev has been built using a _mobile first_ approach. That means that, while we take full advantage of the larger viewports, mobile is never compromised. \r\n\r\nJavascript has been used to make a touch friendly _pull_ menu to use for navigation on small screens.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nCurrently this project is maintained entirely by @pattonwebz but I'd love to receive input from others.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nDo you need to know more? Then visit the Theme-Dev website to see the framework live in action. You can contact me through GitHub or on the site if you have any questions :)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
